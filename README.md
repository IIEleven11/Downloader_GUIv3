# Downloader_GUIv3
Download exe from the releases page. 

Double click it to open and you'll get a simple GUI. 

You can from here add one URL at a time from the "Add URL" button.

You can also create a list of URLs in txt format. ONE URL per line. 

Then click the Load URL button and select the txt file of your list.

Push download to begin the process.

Downloads will be placed in the same folder as urllistdownloader.exe

You will need to have yt-dlp.exe in the same folder or have it's path added to your environment variables. You can get it here - https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp

Sample folder structure could look something like this (list.txt or whatever txt file youre making the list out of doesnt need to be located here or named "list")
